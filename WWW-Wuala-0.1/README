METHODS

___Downloading:

There are at the moment 6 Server from which you can download content.
I let you decide which one you want to use! If you don´t specifie one
the module will take the first server. Changing the Server MAY increase
the download speed.

$wu->server(2) || die "wtf";
chomp($fname = <STDIN>);
$wu->download('Perforin/Images/WUALA3.JPG',$fname) || die "wtf";

You can also download password protected content!

$wu->server(2) || die "wtf";
chomp($fname = <STDIN>);
$wu->download('Perforin/verysecretandprotectedfolder/lulz.PNG',$fname,'KEY') || die "wtf";


___Preview:

%prev = $wu->preview("Perforin");
for $all ( keys %prev ) {
print "@{ $prev{$all} }\n";
}

This example will show us, all of the preview information.
But we can specifie what exactly we want!

@arguments = qw(name url tag);

%prev = $wu->preview("Perforin",@arguments);
for $all ( keys %prev ) {
print "@{ $prev{$all} }\n";
}

OR

@arguments = qw(name url tag);

%prev = $wu->preview("Perforin",@arguments); # OR %prev = $wu->preview("Perforin");
print "@{ $prev{name} }\n"; # Show only the name
print "@{ $prev{url} }\n";  # Show only the url
print "@{ $prev{tag} }\n";  # Show only the tags


Here is the list of all possible values:

type fullname gender birthday contact countrycode prouser name url
creator creationdate sizestring description tag views links favorites comments
familyfriendly publicFolders_name publicFolders_url publicGroups_name publicGroups_url


___Top Items list:

@top = $wu->tops(6,3,4); # Typus To Period
foreach $la (@top) {
print $la . "\n";
}

Well, this here looks a bit confusing but here is the explanation:

The first number stands for the _type_.
Here you got 6 possibilities.
0 Images
1 Videos
2 Music
3 Documents
4 Other file types
5 Users
6 Groups

Then there comes _To_.
This is just a number higher or equal than 1 which indicate the number of Top
Items you want to be showed.

And finaly there is the _Period_.
This one defindes the time period. The following values are possible:
0 Day
1 Week
2 Month
3 Year
4 All Time

In this example, we get 3 top Group Items of all time. Not this hard? :-)


___Metadata:

@res = $wu->metadata('Wuala/Buttons',folder);
foreach $lol (@res) {
print $lol . "\n";
}

This will show you the Metadata of a folder.
The second argument can be changed to:
user
file
group
folder


___mostRecent:

@mr = $wu->mostRecent(1,10); # Typus To
foreach $ma (@mr) {
print $ma . "\n";
}

The first number stands for the _type_.
Here you got 6 possibilities.
0 Images
1 Videos
2 Music
3 Documents
4 Other file types
5 Users
6 Groups

Then there comes _To_.
This is just a number higher or equal than 1 which indicate the number of 
Items you want to be showed.


___Search:

@search = $wu->search('Wuala',5,1);
foreach $pr (@search) {
print $pr . "\n";
}

The first value is your searchstring.

The second is just a number higher or equal than 1 which indicate the number of 
results you want to be showed.

The last value is the search type!
The possible values are:
0 Images
1 Videos
2 Music
3 Documents
4 Other file types
5 Users
6 Groups



And so on and so on. It continues like this ;)
At least I´ll give you a list where you can use a password:

download
preview
metadata
breadcrumb
publicFiles
publicFolgers
comments
commentCount

___XML:

All of those API calls can also be called by putting an _xml behind.
This will give you the XML File send by the Wuala server.

$wu->preview_xml();
$wu->publicFiles_xml();

And so on and so on...

___wualaFilescounter:

Returns the number shown on the Wuala Webpage.
